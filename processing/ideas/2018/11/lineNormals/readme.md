# lineNormals

Shows how to convert a line strip into a mesh version of the same line strip
but with random thicknes per-vertex. Like switching from a thin pen to an
ink-brush.

Here two animated versions in p5.js: [one](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/632717)
and [two](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/675134)
