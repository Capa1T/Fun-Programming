# Fun Programming 

http://funprogramming.org

Here you can encounter two things:

1. Programs written for the Fun Programming video tutorials
2. My creative coding experiments (mostly found in the processing/ideas/ folder).

Most programs found here are written using Processing (http://www.processing.org/).
Some with SuperCollider (http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/).
Both are great languages for creating animated graphics and sound.

Roadmap:

- Upload my sketches (a few hundred still to go, I upload one per day)
- Add descriptions
- Add thumbnails 
- Create a visual index
