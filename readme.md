# Fun Programming

In this repository you can find:

- Programs written for the [Fun Programming](https://funprogramming.org) video
  tutorials: [fun-programming](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/fun-programming)
- My creative coding experiments: [processing/ideas](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/ideas).
  These are not finished work but tests I do while developing a project or experiments done just for fun and out of curiosity.
  Index below. You can view some results at https://hamoid.com and at http://hamoid.tumblr.com/archive

Most programs here are written using [Processing](http://www.processing.org/).
Some with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
They are great for creating static / animated / interactive graphics and sound synthesis.

My current tools include [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org) and GLSL.

### Roadmap

- [x] Create thumbnails
- [x] Create a visual index
- [ ] Add tags to each sketch
- [ ] Upload my sketches, one per day. I should be done in 2020.
- [ ] Write a readme.md for each

This used to be my homepage for a while. Ported to Processing in 2011. One of my first sketches.  It draws animated bezier curves in which start, end and control points follow different bezier curves themselves.   </div>| [noise line<br>![](processing/ideas/2011/08/noise_line/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2011/08/noise_line/) <div class="f6"></div>| [translate rotate<br>![](processing/ideas/2011/08/translate_rotate/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2011/08/translate_rotate/) <div class="f6"></div>| [noise is centered<br>![](processing/ideas/2011/09/noise_is_centered/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2011/09/noise_is_centered/) <div class="f6"> The blue line shows that noise spends most of the time at the center (near the value 0.5). Rarely, if ever, it will go to the top or to the bottom.  This is an attempt to fix that. We modify the noise value (n) in a way that the whole range of values is covered: from 0 to 1.  One drawback with this formula is that it's not continuous. It can disappear on the top and then appear on the bottom.  The red line shows the modified noise value.  </div> |

There are thousands of files online in `.mid` format. I think it's quite an interesting source of data. We often try to get information out of sound using FFT, but that's a very limited approach which doesn't give us the chords and simultaneous notes being played.  Of course using MIDI has its own limitations. For instance, you don't know if the synths being played have short or long decay, so it can be hard to visualize decaying sounds with precision.  In any case, fun to play with I think.  If you create anything with it, I would be happy if you link it at https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/comment/116764 for others to see.  </div>| [extract Audio With Ffmpeg<br>![](processing/ideas/2017/05/extractAudioWithFfmpeg/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2017/05/extractAudioWithFfmpeg/) <div class="f6"></div>| [hsluv<br>![](processing/ideas/2017/05/hsluv/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2017/05/hsluv/) <div class="f6"></div>| [plot3Dfor Jerome<br>![](processing/ideas/2017/05/plot3DforJerome/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2017/05/plot3DforJerome/) <div class="f6"></div> |

The vertex shader calculates a new position of each vertex based on sines and cosines of the original vertex coordinates.  It also shows how to directly use gl_Position to place things in the window.  It makes use of a ShaderReloader class, based on code by Raphaël de Courville.

That fill color represents depth and it's used by the shader to know where to draw drop shadows. The shader colorizes each shape using a cosine based palette generator.  This is not necessarily a good idea :) It's just an experiment.

The cuboids are shaded with a shader that produces stripes along one axis. The axis is specified as a integer `uniform` between 0 and 2 for each drawn cuboid. You can access a component of a vec3 in a shader by its index, so `pos[0] = pos.x`, `pos[1] = pos.y` and `pos[2] = pos.z`.  Hold down the mouse button to see the effect of `OPTIMIZED_STROKE`. For me the default state of that property in Processing is not the expected one, as `OPTIMIZED_STROKE` produces unwanted side effects when using vertex shaders. If something is not working with your vertex shader I suggest toggling that variable to `ENABLED` and `DISABLED` to see if it has an effect.   </div>| [pan Zoom Sketch<br>![](processing/ideas/2018/08/panZoomSketch/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2018/08/panZoomSketch/) <div class="f6">  A simple class that allows showing a larger PGraphics in a smaller viewport, pan and zoom using the mouse.

Like switching from a thin pen to an ink-brush.  Here two animated versions in p5.js: [one](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/632717) and [two](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/675134)  And a version in [OPENRNDR](https://github.com/hamoid/openrndr-template/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/p5/p07_lineNormals.kt)   </div>| [bidirectional Perlin Noise<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/01/bidirectionalPerlinNoise/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/01/bidirectionalPerlinNoise/) <div class="f6"> Noise field. A typical effect is sampling a noise field by using the current pixel coordinates then interpreting the obtained value as an angle to move to a nearby pixel, and keep repeating that operation. The resulting image resembles somewhat roots or branches: lines that converge.  In this case I repeat the process twice, the second time inverting the displacement sign. So for the starting point I obtain two lines instead of one, and they go in exactly opposing directions. The difference is that it looks less like branches or roots because one can not see the beginning of those brances or roots. It's like connecting the branches of two trees together, each branch connecting with a branch in the other tree.  Try changing the sigmoid value between 0.0 and 1.0 for different looks.   </div>| [bump In Circle<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/01/bumpInCircle/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/01/bumpInCircle/) <div class="f6"> Draws circles with a bump. The bump is located at an angle defined by the variable `high`. The width of the bump is defined by `overlap`, which is modulated over time to make it more dynamic, while using an offset so not all circles are wide or narrow at the same time, but in sequence instead.  </div>| [click To Erase<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/01/clickToErase/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/01/clickToErase/) <div class="f6"> A program that draws two layers and allows the user to interactively erase the top layer by dragging the mouse while holding the left mouse button down.

The color of each square is chosen randomly from a list of colors. The squares are shaded with a circular gradient, implemented in a shader. Then a "tornado" effect is applied to the center of the window, deforming the squares.  There's an artifact when curving some lines that I later [solved](https://creativecodeberlin.github.io/Stammtisch/2019/05/03/ccs061.html) when porting this program to OPENRNDR.  </div>| [gradient With Vertex<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/04/gradientWithVertex/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/04/gradientWithVertex/) <div class="f6"> Draw a grid of rectangles covering the screen and maintaining a margin between rectangles and the borders of the window.  The recangles are filled with a gradient and also have a gradient stroke. This is achieved by setting the fill and stroke colors before each call to `vertex()`.  A better approach to gradients is by using shaders, as this technique does not allow rotating the gradient and is heavily influenced by the number of vertices and their order.   </div>| [variable Thickness Lines<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/04/variableThicknessLines/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/04/variableThicknessLines/) <div class="f6"> Shader based line drawing that produces lines that go from zero strokeWeight to full strokeWeight and back to zero. The program allows reloading the shader by pressing '0', and loading other shaders (if they were present) by pressing other number keys.  Press `r` to randomize, `s` to save.   </div>| [crosses<br>![](processing/ideas/2019/06/crosses/.thumb.jpg)](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/blob/master/processing/ideas/2019/06/crosses/) <div class="f6"> A program to generate the cover for the [Creative Code Stammtisch 62](https://creativecodeberlin.github.io/Stammtisch/2019/06/07/ccs062.html).
