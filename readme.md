# Fun Programming

In this repository you can find:

- Programs written for the [Fun Programming](https://funprogramming.org) video
  tutorials: [fun-programming](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/fun-programming)
- My creative coding experiments: [processing/ideas](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/ideas).
  These are not finished work but tests I do while developing a project or experiments done just for fun and out of curiosity.
  Index below. You can view some results at https://hamoid.com and at http://hamoid.tumblr.com/archive

Most programs here are written using [Processing](http://www.processing.org/).
Some with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
They are great for creating static / animated / interactive graphics and sound synthesis.

My current tools include [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org) and GLSL.

### Roadmap

- [x] Create thumbnails
- [x] Create a visual index
- [ ] Add tags to each sketch
- [ ] Upload my sketches, one per day. I should be done in 2020.
- [ ] Write a readme.md for each

A typical effect is sampling a noise field by using the current pixel coordinates then interpreting the obtained value as an angle to move to a nearby pixel, and keep repeating that operation. The resulting image resembles somewhat roots or branches: lines that converge.  In this case I repeat the process twice, the second time inverting the displacement sign. So for the starting point I obtain two lines instead of one, and they go in exactly opposing directions. The difference is that it looks less like branches or roots because one can not see the beginning of those brances or roots. It's like connecting the branches of two trees together, each branch connecting with a branch in the other tree.  Try changing the sigmoid value between 0.0 and 1.0 for different looks.
